A Machine Learning Approach for Early Disease Detection in Farm Animals

## Overview

Predictive Veterinary Care is a platform designed to assist farmers and dairy owners in the early detection and management of diseases affecting livestock, such as Mastitis and Lumpy Skin Disease. The system uses machine learning models to analyze both textual symptoms and animal images, providing accurate disease predictions and actionable insights for proactive animal health management.

## Features

- **Symptom & Image Data Entry:** Users can input symptoms and upload animal images for analysis in English, Hindi, or Marathi.
- **Early Disease Detection:** Models can predict diseases at an early stage, focusing on Mastitis and Lumpy Skin Disease.
- **AI-Powered Insights:** Utilizes algorithms like SVM, Random Forest, and CNNs for disease classification and image-based assessment.
- **Accessible Design:** Includes a multi-language, easy-to-use interface suited for rural and urban farmers alike.
- **Veterinary Consultation:** Provides options for scheduling vet appointments and accessing disease prevention information.

## Usage

1. Enter animal health symptoms via the platform interface.
2. Upload clear images of the affected animal.
3. Receive disease predictions and recommended next steps.
4. Access detailed disease information or connect with a veterinarian as needed.

## Objectives

- Enable timely, accurate detection of livestock disease risks.
- Reduce manual inspections and reliance on expert-only diagnosis.
- Improve animal welfare by facilitating preventive and early interventions.

## Technologies

- Machine Learning (SVM, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Deep Learning)
- Computer Vision (Image Analysis)
- Multi-language Support (English, Hindi, Marathi)
- Modular, secure, and maintainable design
